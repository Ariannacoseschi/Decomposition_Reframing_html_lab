Find a website that you like the look of that has interesting design elements
Create a simple high-level wireframe for the website. You can use a tool like Figma, Miro or even draw it yourself. It does not need a lot of detail, but it should include the following:
Header
Navigation
Section

Re-create this Wireframe using HTML and semantic elements. Make sure to include the semantic element for header, nav, section, and footer.
